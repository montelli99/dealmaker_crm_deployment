# Dealmaker System Video 2: The Business Model

## Overview
This video outlines the Dealmaker business model framework, focusing on revenue streams, service offerings, and pricing strategies for capital advisory firms. It provides a comprehensive structure for monetizing deal-making expertise through a combination of engagement fees and success-based compensation.

## Key Components

### Dual Revenue Stream Model

   - Structured as flat fees or milestone-based payments
   - Non-refundable but can be credited against success fees

2. **Success-Based Fees**
   - Contingent compensation tied to transaction completion
   - Equity Raises: 3-7% of capital raised (sliding scale based on amount)
   - Debt Raises: 1-3% of secured debt
   - M&A Transactions: 2-5% based on enterprise value and deal complexity
   - Typically includes minimum fee thresholds to ensure adequate compensation
